AAD1
====

Project of the group AAD1, Aarhus University, Denmark.

For clone the project on your computer:

###1. [Install git, ~1.8](http://msysgit.github.com/) (Windows)

When git is installed, check the install: (Using shell windows/unix)
```
git
```

And the install version, mine is 1.8.3, yours could be upper:
```
git --version
```

###2. Get the repository from here to your computer:
I advice to have a personnal folder similar to our dropbox architecture and put your own code into.

```
git clone https://github.com/Vadorequest/AAD1.git "3 - Source code"
```
Will create the directory **3 - Source code** in the project folder with all the sources.

Later I will learn you how configure your IDE for manage commit, push and pull GIT requests for send and receive to/from the server.
